Description: A light-weighted pure C++ splines implementation for spline regression.
  The package covers several aspects of non-parametric effect modelling using splines.
  The functionality contains the basis creation as dense or spline matrix and techniques
  to shrink the complexity regarding specific degrees of freedom, tensor product splines,
  an efficient base representation to save memory, and a method to subtract matrix bases.
