Description: A lightweighted pure C++ splines implementation that can be used
  for spline regression. The package covers several aspects that makes modelling
  of non-parametric effects much easier. The functionality contains the basis
  creation, the Demmler-Reinsch-Orthogonalization, building tensor products,
  an efficient discretization technique to save memory, as well as a method
  to subtract matrix bases.
